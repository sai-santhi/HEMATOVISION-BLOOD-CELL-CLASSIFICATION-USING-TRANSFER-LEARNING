# HematoVision 🧬 | Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning

HematoVision is a deep learning-powered solution designed to **accurately classify blood cells** using transfer learning techniques. Built on a dataset of 12,000 annotated images, the model distinguishes between four major types of blood cells: **eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes**, and **neutrophils**.

## 🔍 Overview

- 🎯 **Objective**: Build an efficient and scalable blood cell classification model using transfer learning with CNNs.
- 📊 **Dataset**: 12,000 labeled blood cell images from the [Kaggle Blood Cell Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/blood-cells).
- 🔄 **Approach**: Pre-trained models (e.g., MobilenetV2) are fine-tuned to reduce training time and boost classification accuracy.
